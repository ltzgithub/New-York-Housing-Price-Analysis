    "## 1. Background\n",
    "New York City is one of the biggest cities in the world, with 5 Boroughs and hundreds of neighborhoods(254 different neighborhoods in the dataset). Each borough or neighborhood has its own characteristics. With Manhattan as its core, it is densely populated with an estimate of 70,826 inhabitants per square mile <a href='http://worldpopulationreview.com/boroughs/manhattan-population'>**ManhattanPopulation2019**</a>. This population density makes Manhattan the most densely populated of any county in the United States. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative and financial center of New York city, also the financial and cultural center of the world. The other four boroughs, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens are also densely populated of people with different ethnicities. New York City is the world’s most sort-after metropolitan, and is the gateway for immigrants throughout the city’s history. People all over the world come here to live, study, work and invest. The records of the most expensive real estate per square feet for both commercial and residential were made here. In 2019 Manhattan is home to two of the top ten ZiP Codes in the United States by median housing price <a href = 'https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/10-most-expensive-us-zip-codes-for-buying-a-home.html'>**TopTenZipCode2019**</a>. The real estate is a major force for the city’s economy. Therefore the real estate market is an interesting topic for many stakeholders, such as the city officials for planning, New York residents, migrants to the New York City etc.. For example, a job seeker who lands a job in the city likes to know where to stay; a real estate investor likes to know where and when to purchase/sell the properties; etc. Real estate is the most expensive investment in people’s life. Purchasing any real estate is one of the most important decisions in anybody’s lifetime.  For all who are interested in real estate in New York City, these are the two questions they have in their mind: the affordability and availability. Manhattan is home to lots of expensive real estate properties. What makes Manhattan so attractive? We will explore its venues using Foursuqare location data so that we can understand more about the local real estate market."
